## Fitbit App ideas:

- Sensor logger with binary general health logger (Yes/No)
	- Collect specified sensory at defined intervals
	- Prompt a questionaire on the watch to ask about general well-being for the day:
		- Are you tired?
		- Have you worked out today?
			- (if yes), what type of workout is it > branch out to specifics
		- Have you eaten since the last questionaire?
			- (if yes), was it a proper meal or a snack?

- Google Maps integration:
	- On fitbit app set the destination where you want to go
	- Google maps downloads the map (zoomed in) and stores it on the fitbit watch
	- watch references the location of the map and gives you directions
		- One buzz to change direction
		- Two sharp buzzes to tell you you're off course
